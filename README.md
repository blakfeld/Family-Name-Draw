#Family Name Draw

My family is quite large and spread out across the US. But we always come
together for Christmas. In order to have Christmas not break the bank, we
draw names of all the adults so we only have to buy for one adult, and then the
kids.

Since we live in different areas, it became difficult to get together and draw
names out of a hat, so I whipped this up so we could just do it that way.

This is also a pretty good example of a super basic Flask app useing SQLite and
Bootstrap.

## Install

Clone down, and run:

``` shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use locally, first create the database:

``` shell
python db_create.py
```

Then run:

``` shell
python run.py
```

Now the app is running on http://localhost:5000
