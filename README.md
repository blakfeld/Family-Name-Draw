# Family Gift App

Every year my family draws names out of a hat to do a sort of Secret Santa
for Christmas. This got difficult once all of us no longer lived in the same
general area, so I wrote an application to help simplify this porcess.

## Usage

```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python ./family_gift_app/app.py
```
